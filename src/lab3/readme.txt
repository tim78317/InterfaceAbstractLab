
Objectives for Lab #3:
---------------------
   * Practice using both an interface and an abstract class as super classes
     for sub classes of your choosing (invent something, but don't use
     anything previously used in class).
   * Many students like to design classes for a video game. But if you'd prefer
     to do something else, dream up your own program. But here are some other
     suggestions: a billing system, a student registration system, a Facebook
     like system.
   * IMPORTANT:
     This program does not have to be fully functional. You can create methods,
     for example, that don't have any or much code in them. The point of this
     exercise is to get you to make the right choices regarding your selection
     of classes, and the names of those classes, and to determine what 
     properties and methods you need. Don't waste time making this program
     functional.

Instructions for Lab #3:
----------------------
1. Follow the 4 steps of OOA/D: First, do Generic Analysis -- make sure you 
   understand what you are being asked to do and the requirements. Second, do
   Generic Design -- think about your conceptual solution (you could just 
   doodle on a piece of paper or write down some ideas on a notepad. The point 
   is to stop and think about what you'll need to do before you start coding. 
   Third, do Object-Oriented Analysis -- find the conceptual objects in the
   problem domain. On a sheet of paper make a list of all possible nouns that
   you can think of that would be used in your program. Those are your 
   conceptual objects. You may change them later, but at least you have a
   starting point. Finally, do Object-oriented Design -- this is where you take
   your conceptual solution and your conceptual objects to the next level. Now
   you must skillfully assign responsibilities (methods and properties) to
   objects. This is where you start writing code.
2. Which super classes should be concrete vs. abstract vs. Interface? 
   Justify your choices by adding comments to each class.
3. Which properties should be declared in super classes and which
   should be declared in the sub classes? Justify your choices by 
   adding comments to the property declarations.
4. Which super class methods should be abstract vs. concrete. Justify your 
   choices by adding comments to the property declarations. If making a method
   concrete, should it be final? Comment as to why or why not.
5. Can you think of any other ways to improve on this design? If so, 
   document your ideas in a comment in the startup class.
